Ejercicio 1, Desde la Tabla Fligths, este comando SQL:

SELECT COUNT(idFlight) FROM flights


Ejercicio 2, Desde la Tabla Fligths, este comando SQL:

SELECT Origin, AVG(ArrDelay) as prom_arrivades , AVG(DepDelay) as prom_sortides
FROM flights
GROUP by Origin
order by Origin ASC

Ejercicio 3, 

SELECT Origin, colYear,colMonth, ArrDelay * 1.0000 as promig_arrivades
from flights
order by Origin, colYear, colMonth

paja mental que me hice:

SELECT CONCAT(Origin, ",", colYear, ",", colMonth, ",", DayOfMonths, ",", ArrDelay)
FROM flights
ORDER BY colYear

Ejercicio 4 

SELECT d.city, t.colYear, t.colMonth, t.ArrDelay * 1.0000 as promig_arrivades
from flights t
LEFT JOIN usairports d
ON IATA = Origin
Order by d.city, t.colYear, t.colMonth

Ejercicio 5

SELECT UniqueCarrier, colYear, colMonth, AVG(DepDelay), sum(Cancelled) as cancelados
from flights
group by colYear,colMonth
having cancelados>=1
ORDER BY SUM(Cancelled) DESC

Ejercciio 6

SELECT TailNum, sum(Distance)
from flights
WHERE TailNum !=""
group by TailNum
Order by Sum(Distance) DESC
LIMIT 10


Ejercicio 7

SELECT UniqueCarrier, avg(ArrDelay)
from flights
group by UniqueCarrier
having Avg(ArrDelay)>=10
order by Avg(ArrDelay) DESCC
